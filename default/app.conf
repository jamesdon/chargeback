description = The Charge Back App is intended to calculate maintenance and yearly run rates for Splunk.    

If you are running Splunk in a medium to large environment, you are probably sharing Splunk with other groups.  In many places, this results in one group running Splunk as a service for any number of internal customers.  The challenge then becomes sharing the maintenance and run costs of the infrastructure.  As a Splunk administrator, I would have to run several long-running searches to try and figure out the costs.  This App should put all of that to rest.
